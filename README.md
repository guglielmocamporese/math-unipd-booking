# Minimal API for the COVID Booking System of the Offices at the UniPD Math Dep 

Currently for registering the presence at the math department you have to manually login into the math website and fill several forms EVERY day. In order to speedup this process, this project proposes a minimal interface of the COVID booking system of the math unipd website that you can use the simple API written in Python.

### Requirements
- You have to clone the repo:
```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/guglielmocamporese/math-unipd-booking-bot.git

# go the project folder
cd math-unipd-booking-bot
```
- You have to use Python 3.x (specifially I used Python 3.7, but 3.x should be ok),
- You need the `lxml`, `pandas` and `python-telegram-bot` packages installed,
- You need to extend the permissions for the bash scripts:
```bash
# extend files permissions
chmod +x ./scripts/book ./scripts/check ./scripts/remove
```

### Example of Usage
```bash
# Book the office
./scripts/book # book the office 732 from 9:00 to 18:00, today
./scripts/book --office 702 --tomorrow # book the office 702 from 9:00 to 18:00, tomorrow
./scripts/book --next_week -ta 10 -td 19 # book the office 732 from 10:00 to 19:00, all the next week
./scripts/book --this_month # book the office 732 from 9:00 to 18:00, all this month

# Check reservations
./scripts/check --this_month # check all my reservations of this month in office 732

# Remove reservations
./scripts/remove --this_week # remove all my reservations of this week in office 732
```
